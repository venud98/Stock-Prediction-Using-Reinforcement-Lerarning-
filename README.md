# Stock-Prediction-Using-Reinforcement-Lerarning-

The below project is  a Stock Prediction based on Machine Learning and TensorFlow  .
We have trained and predicted model using the Stock Prices of Apple  , Motorola and StarBucks of 5 years .
With the help of Reinforcement Learning we have predicted the prices of the stocks and 
decided whether to buy , hold or sell the stocks .
The following project has been implemented using the Keras API of the TensorFlow .

The aapl_msi_sbux.csv file contains the data regarding the opening stock price and closing stock price of the respective stock.
The plot_rl_rewards.py file contains the code for plotting the profit .
